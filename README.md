  **SEM** [s…õ:m] is methodology of writing and organizing CSS. It stands for "**S**ets of **E**lements and **M**ixes", because the main idea of the methodology is to create *elements* and *mixes* organizing them into separate *sets*. This document is a short and clear definition of what the key terms and rules of SEM. It isn't a mock to BEM or to any other methods like ACSS, SMACSS, OOCSS and other. Probably it has similarities, but share another idea.

  ## Preface

It took over than 2 years before rules, terms and key concepts are determined by practice. As a result, methodology not only introduce just some level of abstraction, but make it possible to share the code, scale indefinitely, style document in WYSIWYG-like editor and work with Web Components in the way you may like.
