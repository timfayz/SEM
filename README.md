**SEM** [sɛ:m] is a methodology for writing and organizing CSS code. It stands for concepts names: "**S**ets of **E**lements and **M**ixes". The main idea of the methodology is to create one-property classes (`.elements {}`), combine them into compound classes (`._mixes {}`) and forming right *sets* of both. More information can be found in the documentation below. SEM is not a mock to BEM or to any other methodologies like ACSS, SMACSS, OOCSS and others. Probably, it has similarities but shares another idea.

## Preface
SEM is born as a consequence of the development of [elementcss](https://github.com/timfayz/elementcss) - Sass library for fast GUI prototyping. It took over than 2 years before rules, terms and key concepts are determined by the practice. As a result, methodology not only introduce some new level of abstraction, but make it possible to share CSS code, scale indefinitely, style document in WYSIWYG-like editor and work with new coming Web Components in convenient way.
