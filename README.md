[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/timfayz/elementcss?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

**SEM** [s…õ:m] is methodology of writing and organizing CSS. It stands for "**S**ets of **E**lements and **M**ixes", because the main idea of the methodology is to create *elements* and *mixes* organizing them into separate *sets*. This document is a short and clear definitions of what the key terms and rules of SEM. It isn't a mock to BEM or to any other methods like ACSS, SMACSS, OOCSS and other. Probably it has similarities but share another idea.

##Preface
SEM is born as consequence of the development of [elementcss](https://github.com/timfayz/elementcss) framework. It took over than 2 years before rules, terms and key concepts are determined by practice. As a result, methodology not only introduce just some level of abstraction, but make it possible to share the code, scale indefinitely, style document in WYSIWYG-like editor and work with Web Components in the way you may like.

###Problem
Before we start I want to caution. My vision of the problem can differ or be absolutely different from yours. SEM came intuitively during the practice and not from crafted problem formulation in the past. So this is rather a clarification of why it's born than a real problem isn't solved until today.

Let's start at the beginning. How many times you faced with a problem when after some time you have noticed your styles have aged and clogged. If you have more than one project and you don't strictly comply any CSS methodologies the problem is probably common to you. For example:

Every knows that create complex and nested structures is in your stylesheets it's not CSS was intended for.

###Solutions
Let's take a brief review of the most well-known methodologies and its drawbacks in context of the previously stated problem:

- BEM. Probably the most popular methodology today.
- ACSS. 

##Thanks
The SEM is can be mixed with other techniques.
